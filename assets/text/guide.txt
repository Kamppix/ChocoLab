Hello and welcome to ChocoLab!


In this game, you will have to use a bit of imagination and preferably also take notes to
create the most delicious type of edible stuff there is: chocolate.

There are three starting ingredients that you will use to achieve your goal:
water, cucumber and gravel. Yes. You read correctly. This is a weird game, okay?

You can take as many of the starting ingredients as you want by clicking on them
below the 5x2 inventory grid. If your inventory gets full, you can trash some of the
ingredients by moving them into the trash can.

Behind this massive box of text, there are five different machines that each process
ingredients differently. To use these machines:
1. Make sure the output (bottom) slots of the machine are empty.
2. Place ingredients into the input (top) slots.
3. If a new ingredient appears faded in the output slot, press the big green 'START'
    button to start creating that ingredient.

The first machine combines two items, taking some of each ingredient's properties into
account. The second one splits an ingredient into two different ones with the same
logic as the first machine. The third machine... Well... It transmutes ingredients into
others alike. For example, a potato into another root vegetable. The fourth and fifth
machines are for heating and cooling.

Just to throw it out there, everything is controlled with the mouse so don't bother
pressing a n y keys. Also, don't mind the stars that might appear below the logo text.

If you need to read this again, you can do so by clicking on the question mark in the
top right corner.


Have fun, I guess.
