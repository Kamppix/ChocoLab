# ChocoLab 
A puzzle game where you process the weirdest of raw ingredients into chocolate with five different machines.

<br>

This is my first ever complete game and it took a little over 30 hours of development to make. The code and assets were all made from scratch during [LÃ–VE Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam-2021).

## Instructions
- Point and click with mouse to move items
- No keyboard is needed to *win* the game
- Actual instructions are shown in-game

### This game doesn't save any progress. Only close the window if you're ready to lose everything you've worked hard for.

**P.S:** This game is absolutely not made to simulate any kind of actual chocolate making process, but to make you lose your mind trying to figure out and remember all of the absurd recipes that are used. Please do not try making actual chocolate like it's made in the game. :)
